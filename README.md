Paypal export payments sent to PNG files


I needed to print each of my paypal invoices but there's currently no way to do this easily.

The runexport.py script uses Ghost.py to scrape the paypal website and takes screenshots of your invoices.

The print_files.sh file will trim the whitespace from the PNGs and send to your default printer.
